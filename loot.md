 #### Loot Distribution
 - Loot is distributed with DKP
 - Socials and Alts does not earn nor can spend DKP.
 - Monolith DKP used for bidding. Everyone needs to have addon installed.
 - Bidding period is started with loot master opening items for loot. Highest bidder awarded item for the cost of second highest bid or minumum bid.
 - If Loot Master sees a reason to repeat the bidding he might repeat bidding. (ie. someone disconnecting at the bidding session)
 - Each item has a minimum price that is posted on either guild website or discord.
 - Item may be opened to roll for OS if no one needs the item.
 - Items cannot be obtained as MS without paying minimum DKP price.
 - If a player doesnt have the minimum DKP for the Item although he is the only one needing item for MS, he is deducted all the remaining DKP he has.
 #### Loot Prioritization
- **Loot Prio by Ranks**
	 - Core Raider = Raider > Social = Alt
 - **Loot Prio among Classes**
	 - Guild website or Discord will have links to tables listing priotization for each item.
	 - This prioritization is determined with management with the input of class leaders.
	 - Usually this prioritization is to favor overall guild performance.
	 - Usually there is a better alternative for an item if any class is not the top priority.
- **Loot Counciled Items**
	- Tanks doesnt spend DKP so their loot is loot counciled. 
	- Any loot affecting other classes is listed on the priotization tables or seperately announced on discord.
	- It's members of other classes' duty to follow these prioritazations. Loot Master is not responsible for any inconvenience people might have.
	- Some items are also put on a rotation table. Having rotating between amongst tanks/dps or other classes. These rotations are also stated on the prioritization tables.
	- Legendaries are loot counciled.
