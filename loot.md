 #### Loot Distribution
 - Loot is distributed with DKP
 - Monolith DKP used for bidding. Everyone needs to have addon installed.
 - Bidding period is started with loot master opening items for loot. Highest bidder awarded item for the cost of second highest bid or minumum bid.
 - If Loot Master sees a reason to repeat the bidding he might repeat bidding. (ie. someone disconnecting at the bidding session)
 - Each item has a minimum price that is posted on either guild website or discord.
 - Item may be opened to roll for OS if no one needs the item.
 - Items cannot be obtained as MS without paying minimum DKP price.
 - If a player doesnt have the minimum DKP for the Item although he is the only one needing item for MS, he is deducted all the remaining DKP he has.
- **Socials and Alts**
	- Socials and Alts does can not earn nor spend DKP.
	- Alts can earn dkp for mains only if they requested to come as alts to maintain raid balance by raid leader.
- **20-Man Raids**
	- These rules are applied only on raids that consist only guild members.
	- Its not encouraged to take pugs into guild raids unless there is a high need.
	- Loot is distributed with group loot.
	- Loot priotization for ranks also apply in 20-Man raids.
	- Socials and Alts can greed item and then ask in raid chat. If everyone greeds the item, specified item can be traded to social or alt. If there is more than one social or alt they roll for the item.
 #### Loot Prioritization
- **Loot Prio by Ranks**
	 - Core Raider = Raider > Social = Alt
 - **Loot Prio among Classes**
	 - Guild website or Discord will have links to tables listing priotization for each item.
	 - This prioritization is determined with management with the input of class leaders.
	 - Usually this prioritization is to favor overall guild performance.
	 - Usually there is a better alternative for an item if any class is not the top priority.
- **Loot Counciled Items**
	- Tanks doesnt spend DKP so their loot is loot counciled. 
	- Any loot affecting other classes is listed on the priotization tables or seperately announced on discord.
	- It's members of other classes' duty to follow these prioritazations. Loot Master is not responsible for any inconvenience people might have.
	- Some items can be put on a rotation prio. Having rotating between amongst tanks/dps or other classes. These rotations are also stated on the prioritization tables.
	- Legendaries are loot counciled.
